<h1>&lt;Sympathy for the peasants&gt; </h1>
<h2> Hoeing millet in mid-day heat,</h2>
<h2>Sweat dripping to the earth beneath.</h2>
<h2>Do you know the food on your plate,</h2>
<h2>Each grain was hard-earned. </h2>

<h1>&lt;On A Quiet Night &gt; </h1>
<h2> I saw the moonlight before my couch, </h2>
<h2>And wondered if it were not the frost on the ground. </h2>
<h2>I raised my head and looked out on the mountain moon, </h2>
<h2>I bowed my head and thought of my far-off home.</h2>
